# The Turing Archive: A Self-Directed Machine Learning Study

This repository functions as the official, long-term archive documenting the self-directed machine learning (ML) study curriculum of **Arham Jawad**, an 11-year-old independent ML researcher and developer.

The archive contains structured materials designed for rigorous technical documentation:

* **Conceptual Notes:** Detailed, self-generated explanations and analytical insights, formatted in Markdown.
* **Implementation Code:** Clean, reproducible Python and PyTorch implementations of core ML algorithms.

To facilitate comprehensive understanding, each major topic is accompanied by an explanatory **YouTube video**, where the concepts are presented using hand-drawn notes for visual clarity.

## Repository Structure

The archive adheres to a consistent, modular organization for maximum navigability:

* **`TopicXX_Name/`**: Folder dedicated to a specific machine learning concept (e.g., `Topic01_LinearRegression`).
* **`notes.md`**: Contains the formal theoretical background and mathematical explanations for the topic.
* **`code.py`**: Contains the runnable Python code implementing the concept, utilizing libraries such as **PyTorch**.
